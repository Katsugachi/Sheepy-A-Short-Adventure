## About the Port

- Sheepy was developed using **Construct**, which exports its games as HTML/CSS/JS.  
- The official Windows release bundles these files inside an NW.js container.  
- By extracting the `package.nw` file, the game runs natively in the browser with no need for NW.js.  
- This port is as close to “source-accurate” as possible without the original `.c3p` project.
